This is an open-source binary convertor. It converts to decimal or a character.

Features:
1. I don't own C++, so it is open-source. You can use it without mentioning even mentioning GitHub.
2. Works with C++, so it must be fast.
3. Converts binary to characters or decimals.
4. I will see the best modifications of this repository, and the best idea will be added to the base version.

Usage:
Compile the code, and start the executable file.
